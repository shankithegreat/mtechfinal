Task: Feature Flag Cleanup (Production Refactoring) Role: Senior Developer Target Flag: @targetflag

Instructions:

Logic Promotion: Remove the conditional check for @targetflag to make the feature permanent.

Conditional Handling:

If the flag is a negative guard (e.g., if (!enabled) { throw/return }), delete the entire block.

If the flag is a positive wrapper (e.g., if (enabled) { ... }), remove the wrapper and promote the inner logic.

Strict Scope: Do not modify unrelated code. Preserve all existing comments and logic exactly.

Formatting: Adjust indentation of promoted logic to match the surrounding scope.

CRITICAL - Output Format: Return ONLY the raw source code. Do not use markdown code blocks (```). Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or concluding remarks.
